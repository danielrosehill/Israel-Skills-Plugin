# Israel-Shopping

Israeli shopping workflows for Claude Code — tech retailers, Zap price comparison, Hebrew term resolution, ILS conversion, and RRP/market checks.

> Renamed from `Israel-Skills` on 2026-04-20. The scope was always shopping; the new name reflects it. Non-shopping Israel utilities will live in a separate plugin.

## Commands (slash)

- `/tech-product-search` — search tier-1 IL tech retailers (Ivory, KSP, Bug, TMS) with Hebrew-term resolution and a Tavily→WebFetch→Playwright fallback chain.
- `/general-search` — broader Israeli retail search (Ace, Home Center, Office Depot, Audioline, Google IL, Zap).
- `/search-zap` — query zap.co.il, the canonical Israeli price-comparison aggregator.
- `/rrp-check` — compare an Israeli price against international RRP / market pricing.
- `/convert-currency` — ILS ↔ USD/EUR/GBP conversion.
- `/pn-check` — given an IL product listing, find the canonical manufacturer part-number on the international market.
- `/store-zap-lookup` — given a retailer name, find its Zap profile URL, rating, and review count.
- `/whats-this-brand` — identify an obscure Israeli-market brand (white-label, importer-specific, OEM equivalent).
- `/freier-check` — playful "are you a freier" verdict given an IL price and international RRP.
- `/add-store` — append a vendor to the user's persistent store overlay (survives plugin updates).

Strategy and know-how (Hebrew terms, URL patterns, Playwright fallback, sourcing waterfall, store-merge convention) live in [`docs/search-strategies.md`](docs/search-strategies.md). The commands reference it rather than restating.

## Data

Store metadata is read live from [`danielrosehill/Israel-Online-Stores`](https://github.com/danielrosehill/Israel-Online-Stores) (`stores.json`) — 800+ Israeli retailers with tier, delivery, Eilat-door, and Zap-profile metadata. User-added stores overlay this list from `<plugin-data-dir>/user-stores.json` (`$CLAUDE_USER_DATA/israel-shopping/user-stores.json`, or the XDG/`~/.local/share/claude-plugins/israel-shopping/` fallback — see the `meta-tools:plugin-data-storage` canonical skill) and survive plugin updates.
